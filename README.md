# Rails Rspec Challange

In this challenge you will begin by git cloning an existing Rails application. Make sure you can start the Rails application by running ```bundle exec rails server```

The objectives of this challenge are to:


1. Fix the Rails application so that the existing tests pass

2. Implement the tests marked as pending

###RULES

1. You are not allowed to edit existing view files (you ARE allowed to create new ones)

2. You are not allowed to modify existing tests, except when removing ```pending``` to complete the implementation
